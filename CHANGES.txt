Changelog
===========

0.3 (unreleased)
------------------

* The glob_data_files hook became a pre-command hook for the install_data
  command instead of being a setup-hook.  This is to support the additional
  functionality of requiring data_files with relative destination paths to be
  install relative to the package's install path (i.e. site-packages).

* The `svn_info_pre_hook` and `svn_info_post_hook` have been replaced with
  `version_pre_command_hook` and `version_post_command_hook` respectively.
  However, a new `version_setup_hook`, which has the same purpose, has been
  added.  It is generally easier to use and will give more consistent results
  in that it will run every time setup.py is run, regardless of which command
  is used.  `stsci.distutils` itself uses this hook--see the `setup.cfg` file
  and `stsci/distutils/__init__.py` for example usage.

* Instead of creating an `svninfo.py` module, the new `version_` hooks create a
  file called `version.py`.  In addition to the SVN info that was included in
  `svninfo.py`, it includes a `__version__` variable to be used by the
  package's `__init__.py`.  This allows there to be a hard-coded `__version__`
  variable included in the source code, rather than using pkg_resources to get
  the version.

* In `version.py`, the variables previously named `__svn_version__` and
  `__full_svn_info__` are now named `__svn_revision__` and `__svn_full_info__`.


0.2.1 (2011-09-02)
------------------

* Fixed the dependencies so that setuptools is requirement but 'distribute'
  specifically.  Previously installation could fail if users had plain
  setuptools installed and not distribute

0.2 (2011-08-23)
------------------

* Initial public release
