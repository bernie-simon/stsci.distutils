Changelog
===========

0.3 (unreleased)
------------------

* The ``glob_data_files`` hook became a pre-command hook for the install_data
  command instead of being a setup-hook.  This is to support the additional
  functionality of requiring data_files with relative destination paths to be
  install relative to the package's install path (i.e. site-packages).

* Dropped support for and deprecated the easier_install custom command.
  Although it should still work, it probably won't be used anymore for
  stsci_python packages.

* Added support for the ``build_optional_ext`` command, which replaces/extends
  the default ``build_ext`` command.  See the README for more details.

* The ``svn_info_pre_hook`` and ``svn_info_post_hook`` have been replaced with
  ``version_pre_command_hook`` and ``version_post_command_hook`` respectively.
  However, a new ``version_setup_hook``, which has the same purpose, has been
  added.  It is generally easier to use and will give more consistent results
  in that it will run every time setup.py is run, regardless of which command
  is used.  ``stsci.distutils`` itself uses this hook--see the `setup.cfg` file
  and `stsci/distutils/__init__.py` for example usage.

* Instead of creating an `svninfo.py` module, the new ``version_`` hooks create
  a file called `version.py`.  In addition to the SVN info that was included
  in `svninfo.py`, it includes a ``__version__`` variable to be used by the
  package's `__init__.py`.  This allows there to be a hard-coded
  ``__version__`` variable included in the source code, rather than using
  pkg_resources to get the version.

* In `version.py`, the variables previously named ``__svn_version__`` and
  ``__full_svn_info__`` are now named ``__svn_revision__`` and
  ``__svn_full_info__``.

* Fixed a bug when using stsci.distutils in the installation of other packages
  in the ``stsci.*`` namespace package.  If stsci.distutils was not already
  installed, and was downloaded automatically by distribute through the
  setup_requires option, then ``stsci.distutils`` would fail to import.  This
  is because the way the namespace package (nspkg) mechanism currently works,
  all packages belonging to the nspkg *must* be on the import path at initial
  import time.

  So when installing stsci.tools, for example, if ``stsci.tools`` is imported
  from within the source code at install time, but before ``stsci.distutils``
  is downloaded and added to the path, the ``stsci`` package is already
  imported and can't be extended to include the path of ``stsci.distutils``
  after the fact.  The easiest way of dealing with this, it seems, is to
  delete ``stsci`` from ``sys.modules``, which forces it to be reimported, now
  the its ``__path__`` extended to include ``stsci.distutil``'s path.


0.2.1 (2011-09-02)
------------------

* Fixed the dependencies so that setuptools is requirement but 'distribute'
  specifically.  Previously installation could fail if users had plain
  setuptools installed and not distribute

0.2 (2011-08-23)
------------------

* Initial public release
